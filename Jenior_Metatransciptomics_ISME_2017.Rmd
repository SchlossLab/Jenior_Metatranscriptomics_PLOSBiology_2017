###Results

***C. difficile* differentially expresses virulence factors across separate classes of antibiotic pretreatment.**
Prior to oral *C. difficile* str. 630 spore challenge, conventionally-reared SPF mice were pretreated with one of three different antibiotics to sensitize the animals to *C. difficile* colonization. The selected antibiotics were streptomycin, cefoperazone, and clindamycin (Table S1). Each drug was chosen not only due to its ability to reduce *C. difficile* colonization resistance in a mouse model [@Schubert2015], but also for their distinct and significant impacts on the structure and diversity of the cecal microbiota (all *p* < 0.001; Fig. S1a). Selection of this toxigenic *C. difficile* strain was based on its moderate clinical severity in mouse models [@Theriot2011], previous studies of *in vitro* metabolism [@], and well-annotated genome [@VanEijk2015]. Briefly, mice were pretreated with the respective antibiotic as indicated in Fig. 1a and were subsequently orally gavaged ~1×10^3^ *C. difficile* str. 630 spores before necropsy at 18-hours post-infection. This end point corresponded with a previous study where another laboratory strain of *C. difficile* reached maximum cecal vegetative cell density with few detectable spores [@]. 

At this final time-point, we first quantified vegetative *C. difficile* colony forming units (cfu) per gram of cecal content (Fig. 1b). There was no significant difference in the number of vegetative cells between any antibiotic-pretreatment tested and all susceptible mice were colonized to ~1×10^8^ vegetative cfu per gram of cecal content, while untreated mice maintained *C. difficile* colonization resistance. We moved on to measure both sporulation and toxin activity as activation of both processes has been linked to environmental concentrations of specific growth nutrients [@]. Despite having the similar amounts of vegetative *C. difficile* cells, varying levels of both spore cfu and toxin titer were found across each of the antibiotic pretreatment models tested. These results showed that *C. difficile* colonized different antibiotic-pretreated mice to consistently high levels, and the distinct treatments corresponded with moderate differences in the expression of *C. difficile* virulence factors.


***C. difficile* colonization differentially corresponded with structural differences in the cecal bacterial community between antibiotic pretreatments.**
In order to evaluate changes in bacterial population abundances in response to perturbation and *C. difficile* colonization, we performed 16S rRNA gene V4 region sequencing from cecal content of both mock and *C. difficile*-infected mice across antibiotic pretreatment models. To focus analysis specifically on the surrounding bacterial communities, we removed all sequences contributed by *C. difficile* prior to downstream analysis. Following data curation, we first reconfirmed that each antibiotic treatment significantly impacted both cecal community structure (ThetYC distances) and diversity (inverse-Simpson) compared to untreated control mice (all *p* < 0.001, Fig. S1a & S1b). We then ensured that each antibiotic class induced disntict shifts in community which significantly differed from one another (all *p* < 0.001, Fig. S1c). The composition of streptomycin-pretreated communities was more variable between cages, but was generally enriched for members of phylum Bacteroidetes (Fig. 1c). Cefoperazone and clindamycin-pretreated cecal were consistently dominated by the families Lactobacillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae respectively (Fig. 1c). 

Next, we measured the effect that *C. difficile* colonization had on overall community structure and composition for each of the antibiotic groups. We found that structure both streptomycin and clidamycin-pretreated communities were significantly different from their within-group uninfected controls (*p* = 0.014, Fig. S1d; *p* = 0.003, Fig. S1f).
Infected cefoperazone-pretreated communities did not significantly differ from their control group (Fig. S1e). We then sought to identify specific OTUs that significantly differed in abundance between mock and *C. difficile* infection within each pretreatment group. To accomplish this, we utilized LEfSe differential abundant feature detection [@Segata2011] for each perturbed cecal community comparing mock and *C. difficile*-infected conditions. In order to improve the ability to distinguish between potentially informative OTUs and differences that arise from cage effects, we screened for OTUs that appear in at least nine samples for each antibiotic pretreatment separately (n=9 mice per experimental group). This analysis revealed a total of 16 OTUs that discriminated between infected and uninfected communities in at least one antibiotic pretreatment (Fig. 1d-1f). The most frequent differences were seen in the abundance of OTUs at very low relative abundance. In these instances, these OTUs were generally only detectable in either mock of *C. difficile*-infected states. The type of change associated with infection was also not constant in that some OTUs would increase in relative abundance following *C. difficile* colonization while others instead decreased. Additionally, we performed a corrected Wilcoxon rank-sum test for the relative abundance of each discriminating OTU across pretreatments to assess for consistent changes in abundance. In streptomycin pretreatment, only *Porphyromonadaceae* (OTU5) was significantly increased during infection while *Turicibacter* (OTU6) was significantly decreased (*p* < 0.05, Fig. 1d). Cefoperzone-pretreatment was associated with significant inceases in both *Faecalibacterium* (OTU49) and *Arthrobacter* (OTU17) with a decrease in *Lactobacillus* (OTU1) during infection. Finally, the only significantly different OTU in clindamycin pretreatment was *Lactobacillus* (OTU1) which increased with infection. Interstingly, not only was *Lactobacillus* (OTU1) the only OTU which discriminated infection groups within multiple antibiotic pretreatments (cefoperazone & clindamycin), but its relatively abundance significantly increased in both. These results indicated that certain taxonomic groups may be more prominently effected by *C. difficile* colonization than others and implies possible direct or indirect interactions.

***C. difficile* colonization corresponds with shifts in the expression of several metabolic pathways and nutrient acquisition systems accross the cecal microbiome**
Following the changes in abundance of specific bacterial taxa during *C. difficile* colonization we became interested in examining if not only structure of the microbiome was altered, but also the active functionality. In order the most closely analyze which bacterial groups differentially responded to infection, we employed a metagenomic-enabled metatranscriptomic shotgun sequencing approach with paired DNA and RNA samples collected from the cecal content of the mice used in the previous analyses. Metagenomic reads from mock-infected cecal communities were respectively assembled into contigs and putative genes were identified resulting in 234,124 (streptomycin), 83,096 (cefoperazone), and 35,977 (clindamycin) potential genes in each metagenome. Streptomycin pretreatment resulted in a significantly more diverse community (Fig. S1a) than other groups, so a larger detectable metagenome was expected. Putative genes were then annotated according to KEGG and the subset of genes the were successfully annotated with function were utilized for the next analysis; 15.51% (streptomycin), 19.47% (cefoperazone), and 34.78% (clindamycin). Despite utilizing only mock-infected metagenomes for assembly, we still removed genes in which the top alignment was to *C. difficile* prior to read mapping. This was done to avoid skewed results between uninfected and infected metatranscriptomes where *C. difficile* was present to contribute to the transcript pool. Quality-trimmed DNA and cDNA reads from both infected and uninfected conditions were then mapped to the gene catalog that corresponded to their antibiotic pretreatment group of origin. The resulting abundances were normalized to both sequencing read length and target gene length to yeild a per base mapping abundance. Finally, after equal subsampling, metatranscriptomic read abundances for each gene were divided by their corresponding metagenomic coverage in order to normalize for overrepresented genes and species. Therefore, final expression values represent the level of expression upregulation for each gene outside of those from which transcript is abundant but is only expressed at low levels from genes which are highly abundant.

Utilizing the fully normalized metatranscriptomes, we first focused on expressional differences in broadly defined pathways and gene catagories for each antibiotic pretreatment with and without *C. difficile*-infection. To observe these differences we quantified expression of all genes in each community that were annotated as part of a given pathway, regardless of taxonomic information. We then calculated the difference in cDNA abundance for each pathway between infected and uninfected conditions, represented as delta-cDNA abundance. To highlight the largest dfferences, we limited the analysis to the top 5 KEGG pathways with the most change between mock and *C. difficile*-infected conditions within each pretreatment (Fig. 2a). Average expression was nearly identical in either experimental or control, which demonstrated that similar levels of overall transcription was occurring in either state in spite of the large differences shown. In streptomycin and clindamycin pretreatments, greater expression of KEGG pathways was observed in the *C. difficile*-infected metatranscriptomes. Both groups displayed large changes in amino sugar metabolism and ABC transporters, however other distinct carbon metabolism pathways were upregulated in each. Glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation are overrepresented in streptomycin pretreatment while starch/sucorse metabolism and PTS systems were more abundant associated with clindamycin. Together these shifts suggest that these communities differentially adapt carbon metabolism pathways in response to colonization of the invasive species *C. difficile*. Conversely, the largest differences seen in cefoperazone pretreatment were overexpressed in the absence of *C. difficile* infection. These pathways included three separate pathways for the replication or manipulation of genetic material (RNA Processing, tRNA Sythesis, & Homologous Recombination). Instead, many genes involved in anaerobic glucose metabolism and select ABC-transporters are upregulated (Table S3). These results support that the cecal microbiota of infected mice shifts metabolism toward metabolizing simple carbohydrates which could be the result of competition with *C.difficile* for otherwise uncontested resources. 

We then moved on to perform a more fine-scale analysis of changes at the individual gene annotation level selecting the genes in each antibiotic pretreatment group with the largest disparity in normalized cDNA abundance between mock and *C. difficile*-infected groups (Fig. 2b-2d). In agreement with pathway-level differences in expression, the majority genes with high degrees of difference belonged to pathways highlighted in Fig. 2a with three additional pathways relating to amino acid metabolism (I: Glutathione metabolism, J: Valine/Leucine/Isoleucine metabolism, & K: Glycine/Serine/Threonine metabolism). 

A trend appeared in the amount of difference for top-ranking genes in cefoperazone-pretreated communities, as it was much larger than that of the other treatment goups which suggested a greater overall effect of *C. difficile* on transcription of the microbiota under these conditions. It important to note that these groups are equally subsampled, implying that more genes are evenly expressed at lower levels in mock infection instead of a small number of genes highly upregulated. These data expand on our interpretation of pathway-level analysis in that *C. difficile* colonization leads to changes in community-level expression of genes for acquisition and catabolism. Our results also raised questions about which taxonomic groups underscore the differences seen and are potentially more impacted by *C. difficile* colonization than others.






***C. difficile* colonization correlates with large-scale changes in expression of different bacterial taxa between perturbed cecal environments**
In light of large-scale differences in expression across the microbiota concomitant with *C. difficile* colonization, we desired to identify those bacterial groups responsible for the shift in each pretreatment condition. To accomplish this we utilized the genus level taxonomic information associated with each KEGG annotation to identify which group likely contributed a given gene to the metagenome. Many genes in the KEGG database are annotated as hypothetical or uncharacterized but still possess a taxonomic annotation. This resulted in substantially more genes from the total  being conserved for analysis in each group; 19.15% (streptomycin), 25.1% (cefoperazone), and 44.45% (clindamycin). With these data, we narrowed the focus onto transcription for genera that represented >0.01% of genes receiving taxonomic annotations in any of the three metagenomic assemblies. We then directly compared the normalized cDNA abundances for each gene between infected & uninfected states for each antibiotic pretreatment and colored points based on genus classifications (Fig. 3a-3c). Coordinates were determined by the relative expression of each gene in mock and *C. difficile* infection for x and y axes respectively. This causes genes with equal transcription in both conditions being compared to be strongly correlated and positioned proximal to the central diagonal line. As such, we then applied linear correlation and a squared residual cutoff to define those genes that are most strongly upregulated in either condition.

These data revealed distinct changes in expression for underrepresented genera for each antibiotic pretreatment between infections conditions. First, in streptomycin-pretreated mice, the most prominent differences were in 937 genes belonging to *Lactobacillus* were upregulated in *C. difficile* infection (Fig. 3a). Next, in cefoperazone pretreatment 2290 genes belonging to *Bacteroides* were more upregulated in mock infection (Fig. 3b). A consistent trend in streptomycin and cefoperazone pretreatments was an overrepresentation of expression from genera belonging to Bacteroidetes during mock infection. The metatransciptomes for both of these pretreatment poorly correlated with one another, indicating a high degree of change induced by *C. difficile* colonization (*r* = 0.0334 & *r* = 0.031). Finally, in clindamycin pretreatment the largest difference in transcription was for 510 *Lactobacillus* genes during *C. difficile* infection (Fig. 3c). Infected and uninfected metatranscriptomes associated with this antibiotic correlated the more strongly than either other pretreatment (*r* = 0.862), supporting that *C. difficile* colonization had a low impact on transcription of the cecal microbiota. This infection model has been shown to go on to clear *C. difficile* infection witin 7 days, as opposed to long-term colonization, which suggests that communities where *C. difficile* is less able to impact resident members' activity regain colonization resistance more quickly (Fig. S5....). These results from both cefoperazone and clindamycin pretreatments particularly corresponded with LEfSe analysis (Fig. 1e & 1f) where a *Lactobacillus* OTU was shared and significantly altered in abundance by the presence of *C. difficile*. Interestingly, taxonomic groups most highly represented as outliers in the normalized metatranscriptomes of all tested antibiotic pretretreatments were actually minority members of the respective cecal communities as determined 16S rRNA gene abundance (Fig. 1c). On average, *Bacteroides* was the most commonly altered taxa during infection with mean of 441 genes appearing as expression outliers across the three pretreatment goups. As a side note, the presence of Archeael sequences in our shotgun sequencing data was not surprising as the universal 16S rRNA gene V4 region primers we used do not reliably amplify Archeae. Together, our results support that *C. difficile* may differentially modify the transcriptional activity of separate microbial taxa based on the context of the community in which it is colonizing. 


***C. difficile* colonization also corresponds to changes in the cecal metabolome.**
After observing metatranscriptomic differences in numerous metabolic pathways corresponding with *C. difficile* colonization, we hypothesized that these trends lead to downstream effects in overal cecal environment. To accomplish evaluate this posibility, we employed untargeted metabolomic analysis through ultra-performance liquid chromatography

because of casey's and other's work we focused on amino acids, carbohydrates, and lipids...


First, we recomfirmed that antibitoic treatment had a significant impact on the cecal metabolome, shifting it toward a susceptible state (Fig. S4a)

Next, we made the observation that each antibiotic pretreatment resulted in a cecal metabolome that was distinguishable from any of the other classes (Fig. S4b).


We then assessed the degree to which *C. difficile* colonization affected the metabolome of each antibiiotic pretreatment separately 
(Fig. 4)

5-aminovalerate was highly discriminating in each antiabiotic pretreatment group...
It is the byproduct of lysine degradation as a part of Stickland fermentation in *C. difficile* [@Neumann-Schaal2015]. In conjunction with the concomitant decreases in the Stickland fermentation substration...... it seems likely that *C. difficile* seeks to consumes amino acids for carbon and nitrogen in each condition it colonizes.




Unlike within each separate pretreatment, *C. difficile* infection did not have a significant, consistant change in the metabolome of infected versus moc


**Correlating changes in the metabolome and metatranscriptome**

After observing changes in expression at the metatranscriptomic level as well as at the metabolomic level, we were interested to see if the microbiome was responsible for these changes and not C. difficile...


###Discussion

The finding that c diff uses amino acids in each environment agrees with previous research in that....


Our results support the hypothesis that not only does the nutrient niche of *C. difficile* during infection adjust to the susceptible community composition, but also that certain members of the microbiota are differntially impacted by infection.

and contributes the the concept that the healthy gut microbiota maintains colonization resistance to *C. difficile* by outcompeting the pathogen for preferred nutrient niche space.



we acknowledge that colonization could be driven more by the increase in relative abundance or activity of synergistic species or processes with *C. difficile*, however previous work_____ supports competition as the most likely primary contributor... (can, but shouldnt look at synergy in these models)

Colonization resistance to c difficile may be the result of the contribution by distinct subcommunities of bacteria across each unique community. Conversely, these results also offer support to the nutrient niche plasticity of *C. difficile* as it colonizes differentially sensitized gut ecosystems.

###Materials and Methods

**Animal care and antibiotic administration** For a more detailed description of the procedure, refer to Jenior et al. (2017) [@Jenior2017]. In short, conventionally-reared six-to-eight week-old C57BL/6 mice were administered one of three antibiotics; cefoperazone, streptomycin, or clindamycin (As described in Table S1) before oral *C. difficile* infection. All animal protocols were approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals at the University of Michigan and carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines.

***C. difficile* infection and necropsy.** For a more detailed description of the procedure, refer to Jenior et al. (2017) [@Jenior2017]. On the day of challenge, 1×10^3^ *C. difficile* spores were administered to mice via oral gavage in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) vehicle. Mock-infected animals were given an oral gavage of 100 μl PBS at the same time as those mice administered *C. difficile* spores. 18 hours following infection, mice were euthanized and necropsied to obtain the cecal contents. Aliquots were immediately flash frozen for later DNA extraction and toxin titer analysis. A third aliquot was transferred to an anaerobic chamber for quantification of *C. difficile* abundance. The remaining content in the ceca was mixed in a stainless steel mortar housed in a dry ice and ethanol bath. Cecal contents from all mice within each treatment group were pooled into the mortar prior to grinding to a fine powder. The ground content was then stored at -80° C for subsequent RNA extraction.

***C. difficile* cultivation and quantification** For a more detailed description of the procedure, refer to Jenior et al. (2017) [@Jenior2017]. Cecal samples were weighed and serially diluted under anaerobic conditions with anaerobic PBS. Differential plating was performed to quantify both *C. difficile* spores and vegetative cells by plating diluted samples on CCFAE plates (fructose agar plus cycloserine, cefoxitin, and erythromycin) at 37° C for 24 hours under anaerobic conditions [@Wilson1982]. In parallel, undiluted samples were heated at 60° C for 30 minutes to eliminate vegetative cells and leave only spores [@Sorg2010]. These samples were serially diluted under anaerobic conditions in anaerobic PBS and plated on CCFAE with taurocholate at 37° C for 24 hours. Plating was simultaneously done for heated samples on CCFAE to ensure all vegetative cells had been eliminated.

***C. difficile* toxin titer assay** To quantify the titer of toxin in the cecum a Vero cell rounding assay was performed as in [@Leslie2015] and [@Jenior2017]. Briefly, filtered-sterilized cecal content was serially diluted in PBS and added to Vero cells in a 96-well plate. Plates were viewed after 24 hour incubation for cell rounding.

**DNA/RNA extraction and sequencing library preparation** DNA for downstream shotgun metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was extracted from approximately 50 mg of cecal content from each mouse using the PowerSoil-htp 96 Well Soil DNA isolation kit (MO BIO Laboratories) and an epMotion 5075 automated pipetting system (Eppendorf). The V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified using custom barcoded primers [@Kozich2013]. ~2.5 ng of DNA was used to generate shotgun libraries with a modified 10-cycle Nextera XT genomic library construction protocol (Illumina). For RNA extraction, a more detailed description of the procedure can be found in [@Jenior2017]. Briefly, immediately before RNA extraction, 3 ml of lysis buffer (2% SDS, 16 mM EDTA and 200 mM NaCl) contained in a 50 ml polypropylene conical tube was heated for 5 minutes in a boiling water bath [@Lopez-Medina2011]. The hot lysis buffer was added to the frozen and ground cecal content. The mixture was boiled with periodic vortexing for another 5 minutes. After boiling, an equal volume of 37° C acid phenol/chloroform was added to the cecal content lysate and incubated at 37° C for 10 minutes with periodic vortexing. The mixture was the centrifuged at 2,500 x g at 4° C for 15 minutes. The aqueous phase was then transferred to a sterile tube and an equal volume of acid phenol/chloroform was added. This mixture was vortexed and centrifuged at 2,500 x g at 4° for 5 minutes. The process was repeated until aqueous phase was clear. The last extraction was performed with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol to remove acid phenol. An equal volume of isopropanol was added and the extracted nucleic acid was incubated overnight at -20° C. The following day the sample was centrifuged at 12000 x g at 4° C for 45 minutes. The pellet was washed with 0° C 100% ethanol and resuspended in 200 μl of RNase-free water. Following the manufacturer's protocol, samples were then treated with 2 μl of Turbo DNase for 30 minutes at 37° C. RNA samples were retrieved using the Zymo Quick-RNA MiniPrep according the manufacturer's protocol. The Ribo-Zero Gold, immediately before RNA extraction, 3 ml of lysis buffer (2% SDS, 16 mM EDTA and 200 mM NaCl) contained in a 50 ml polypropylene conical tube was heated for 5 minRNA Removal Kit Epidemiology was then used to deplete prokaryotic and eukaryotic rRNA from the samples according the manufacturer's protocol. Stranded RNA-Seq libraries were made constructed with the TruSeq Total RNA Library Preparation Kit v2, both using the manufacturer's protocol. Average length of amplicon libraries for both DNA and cDNA sequencing was performed using an Agilent BioAnalyzer with High Sensativity DNA Analysis kits. Completed libraries were pooled in equal molar ratios within their respective groups and stored at -20C until time of sequencing.

average raw read counts



Stranded RNA-Seq libraries were made constructed with the TruSeq Total RNA Library Preparation Kit v2. The Agilent DNA High Sensitivity Kit was used to measure concentration and fragment size distribution before sequencing. High-throughput sequencing was performed by the University of Michigan Sequencing Core in Ann Arbor, MI. For all groups, sequencing was repeated across 4 lanes of an Illumina HiSeq 2500 using the 2x50 bp chemistry.




**Primary sequencing read curation** Raw sequencing read curation for both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets was performed in a two step process. Residual 5’ and 3’ Illumina adapter sequences were trimmed using CutAdapt [@Martin2013] on a per library basis. Reads were quality trimmed using Sickle (Joshi, 2011) on the default settings. 

An average of \~300,000,000 total reads (both paired and orphaned) remained after quality trimming.


The 16S rRNA gene sequences were curated using the mothur software package (v1.36) as described in [@Jenior2017].
16s analysis - for lefse feature selection OTUs were filtered to appear within at least 9 samples (size of each treatment group).

Similar to metagenomic read processing, raw transcript sequencing read curation was performed in a two step process. Residual 5’ and 3’ Illumina adapter sequences were trimmed using CutAdapt [@Martin2013] on a per library basis. Reads were quality trimmed using Sickle (Joshi, 2011) on the default settings. An average of \~300,000,000 total reads (both paired and orphaned) remained after quality trimming. 

Optical and PCR duplicates were then removed using Picard MarkDuplicates (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/), leaving ~150,000 reads per sample for final analysis. The remaining mappings were converted to idxstats format using Samtools [@Li2009] and the read counts per gene were tabulated. Discordant pair mappings were discarded and counts were then normalized to read length and gene length to give a per base report of gene coverage.

**DNA and cDNA read mapping and normalization**
Mapping was accomplished using Bowtie2 [@Langmead2009] and the default stringent settings. \~1,600,000 reads in sample each mapped to the annotated nucleotide gene 
Unless indicated otherwise, each collection of reads was then 1000-fold iteratively subsampled to 90% of the lowest sequence total within each analysis, and a median expression value for each gene was calculated.

**Quantification of *in vivo* metabolite relative concentrations.** For a more detailed description of the procedure, refer to Jenior et al. (2017) [@Jenior2017]. 
Metabolomic analysis performed by Metabolon (Durham, NC), a brief description of their methods is as follows. All methods utilized a Waters ACQUITY ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive high resolution/accurate mass spectrometer interfaced with a heated electrospray ionization (HESI-II) source and Orbitrap mass analyzer at 35,000 mass resolution. Samples were dried then reconstituted in solvents compatible to each of the four methods. The first, in acidic positive conditions using a C18 column (Waters UPLC BEH C18-2.1x100 mm, 1.7 µm) using water and methanol, containing 0.05% perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPA) and 0.1% formic acid (FA). The second method was identical to the first but was chromatographically optimized for more hydrophobic compounds. The third approach utilized a basic negative ion optimized conditions using a separate dedicated C18 column. Basic extracts were gradient eluted from the column using methanol and water, however with 6.5mM Ammonium Bicarbonate at pH 8. Samples were then analyzed via negative ionization following elution from a hydrophilic interaction chromatography column (Waters UPLC BEH Amide 2.1x150 mm, 1.7 µm) using a gradient consisting of water and acetonitrile with 10mM Ammonium Formate, pH 10.8. The MS analysis alternated between MS and data-dependent MS n scans using dynamic exclusion. The scan range varied slighted between methods but covered 70-1000 m/z. Library matches for each compound were checked for each sample and corrected if necessary. Peaks were quantified using area under the curve.

**Statistical methods.** All statistical analyses were performed using R (v.3.2.0). Significant differences between community structure of treatment groups from 16S rRNA gene sequencing were determined with AMOVA in the mothur software package. Significant differences of Inv. Simpson diversity, cfu, toxin titer, and metabolite concentrations were determined by Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Undetectable points used half the limit of detection for all statistical calculations.

**Figure 2 | Impact of *C. difficile* colonization on other bacterial populations abundances in the gut microbiota.** **(a)** Relative abundance of family-level taxonomic classification for OTUs in each treatment group. **(b-d)** Discriminating OTUs with LEfSe analysis between Mock and *C. difficile*-infected communities within each pretreatment group, *p*-values from LEfSe are shown on the left with taxonomic information (all *p* < 0.05). Relative abundance of the respective OTUs from each mouse along with medians are shown for each pretreatment group. Black asterisks indicate significant difference in relative abundance determined by Wilcoxon rank-sum test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction (*p* < 0.05).

**Figure 3 | *C. difficile* infection alters specific pathway and gene expression of the gut microbiota across perturbed communities** Metatranscriptomic (cDNA) read abundances associated with each gene were normalized to their associated metganomic (DNA) coverage, resulting in values that reflect upregulation and not basal expression levels of highly abundant genes. **(a)** Differences in read abundance for top 5 KEGG pathways with the largest amount of change between Mock and *C. difficile*-infected states within each antibiotic pretreatment. Values above the center line were expressed more during *C. difficile* infection, and those below the line were expressed more in Mock-infected animals. Dotted lines indicate average expression of pathways associated with each condition. **(b-d)** cDNA read abundances of the top 10 genes with the largest differences in expression within each indicated antibiotic pretreatment group. Shown are the expression levels for the genes displayed on the left during Mock (white) or *C. difficile* (black) infection. Gene names and member pathways indicated by letter codes along the left axis (pathway legend below). Abundances for each annotated pathway or gene were reported at the community-level and were agnostic to individual taxonomic group contributions to transcript pool.

**Figure 4 | *C. difficile* colonization alters gene expression of taxonomic groups differentially between antibiotic pretreatements.** Each point represents a unique gene from the respective metagenomic assembly. Coordinates determined by the log~2~-transformed expression level of each gene between *C. difficile*-infected and mock-infected conditions. Metatranscriptomic read abundances are normalized to their associated metganomic coverage. Colored indicate genus of origin, and gray areas denote genes with consistent expression between conditions determined by least squares regression analysis with a minimum residual value of 2. Experimental groups are shown as follows; **(a)** Streptomycin-pretreated, **(b)** Cefoperazone-pretreated, and **(c)** Clindamycin-pretreated. 

**Figure 5 | Impact of antibiotic pretreatment and *C. difficile* infection on cecal metabolome** NMDS ordinations of Bray-Curtis distances comparing the dissimilarity of infection groups within each antibiotic pretreatment; **(a)** Streptomycin, **(b)** Cefoperazone, and **(c)** Clindamycin. Significant differences were determined by AMOVA. Relative concentrations of metabolites with highest Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) from Random Forest feature selection to discriminate between Mock and *C. difficile*-infected conditions within each antibiotic pretreatment; **(d)** Streptomycin, **(e)** Cefoperazone, and **(f)** Clindamycin. Significant differences are labeled along the right axis and were calculated with Wilcoxon rank-sum test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction (\*\*\* < 0.001, \*\* <= 0.01, \* <= 0.05).
